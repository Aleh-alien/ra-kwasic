# Contributing

## Report an issue

You found something broken, some missing translation or you want to discuss anything? [open an issue ](https://github.com/coopdevs/katuma-landing-page/issues/new)

## Pick an issue

You want to contribute :heart_eyes:? Awesome! Head over to the issues section, choose one you like and ask whether you can pick it up.

## Sharing your change

All contributions either bugfixes or new features should be worked on their own branches. To do that start a new branch from `master` and open a pull request against it when you are done. Are you new to this? Read Bitbucket's documentation about [Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).

Once the pull request gets approved it will get merged into `master` and this will trigger a deploy to Github pages, so the changes will be live :tada:.
